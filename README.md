Ruby-Assignment-1
=================
Create the following functions:

Create a function that takes a string and adds the phrase “Only in America!” to the end of it

Create a function to find the maximum value in an array of numbers. For instance:
[100,10,-1000]

should return 100.

Create a function that takes two arguments - both of them arrays. Inside of the function, combine the arrays using the items from the first array as keys and the second array as values. For example, when these two arrays are supplied as arguments:

[:toyota, :tesla]
[“Prius”, “Model S”]

they should return a hash like so:
{toyota: “Prius”, tesla: “Model S”}

2. Create a script that prints out the following pattern 20 times:
    fizzbuzz
    fizzbuzz
    fizz
    fizzbuzz
    buzz
